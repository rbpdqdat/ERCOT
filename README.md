The Jupyter Notebook includes analysis of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using python version 3.5.  The work in this section utilized the python library 'xlrd'.  This library allows the use of many functions to retrieve cell values by row and column as well as aggregrate values.  The 'index' function will also return the position (row & column of specific values).
